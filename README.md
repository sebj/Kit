##Kit

A collection of Objective-C classes and categories I've created whilst working on various projects. You may find something useful here..

###Components

* **CIImage+NSImage**
* **NSBezierPath+Additions** - Smooth an NSBezierPath, get all points
* **NSColor+SJAdditions** - RGB/RGBA string input extensions to NSColor
* **NSImage+SJAdditions** - a few additions on NSImage: blending, masking, flipping etc.
* **NSTableView+RightClickedIndices**
* **SCNNode+SJAdditions**
* **SJACOReader** - read Adobe .aco swatch files and return every color in hex format
* **SJAddressBookAccessor**
* **SJADNShareController** - Add App.net to the Mountain Lion share menu in your app, or use it standalone to share
* **SJExpandingTextView** - a vertically expanding NSTextView, similar to Messages and other chat apps
* **SJTextViewAttachmentsController** - get all files/images dragged into an NSTextview
* **SJView** - use blocks for drawing, animate background changes, get an image from a view
* **StatusItem** - a very simple custom NSStatusItem and view wrapper, allowing for easy subclassing and including delegate methods

##Use
Share, make changes, use commercially if you wish. [Crediting "Seb Jachec"](https://sebj.me) would be nice, but is not necessary.
